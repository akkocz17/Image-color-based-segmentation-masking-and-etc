  ## Project- Harvest Time Alert
     
Our aim is to create a program that informs the harvest time of the photos taken with a camera set up in a garden, by subjecting them to some processes in the system.

We passed the pictures taken by the camera through the image processing stages and obtained a printout about the type of product.

In line with the resulting output, the maturity decision was made according to the color of the fruit and vegetable and it was printed on the screen.
